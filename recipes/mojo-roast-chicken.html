      </p>
      <h4> Ingredients</h4>
      <p>
          <ul>
              <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
              <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
              <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons orange juice</li>
              <li>1 (6 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
              <li>
                Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until very hot. 
                While the oil heats, mash the cumin, salt, oregano, and garlic together into 
                a paste in a heat-proof bowl; whisk the hot oil into the paste. Allow the mixture 
                to cool slightly. Add the lime juice and orange juice; stir. Place the chicken in a 
                large sealable bag; pour the marinade over the chicken and shake to assure an even coating. 
                Refrigerate at least 4 hours, up to overnight.
              </li>
              <li>
                Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange the marinated chicken in a roasting pan. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 
                about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
